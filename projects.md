Here are some small projects I've worked on.

## Git Commits Viewer

A small tool to check out the commits of a github repo. I built this mostly to play around with the github api.

Repo: [https://github.com/luispcosta/git_commits_viewer/](https://github.com/luispcosta/git_commits_viewer/)

Tech: Ruby

## Timetracker

A small CLI tool I've built with the goal of quickly tracking what I'm doing throughout my working days. This is largely unfinished and I've stopped working on it, but it was a good small project
to learn go! I've started by storing data in plain old JSON files on the filesystem and then moved on to using SQLite (you can find this in the commit history).

Repo: [https://github.com/luispcosta/tt](https://github.com/luispcosta/tt)

Tech: Go, SQLite

## Reddit Image Browser

A frontend app to browse images posted in any subreddit.

Repo: [https://github.com/luispcosta/Reddit-Image-Browser](https://github.com/luispcosta/Reddit-Image-Browser)

Tech: JS, Typescript, React
